I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) focusing on Machine Learning, advised by [Prof. Sungjin Ahn](http://sungjinahn.com/). 

I am interested in unsupervised scene representation learning and I am focusing on object-centric scene representations. I am also interested in the applications of object-centric scene representations in reinforcement learning.

Before joining Ph.D. in 2018, I worked at IBM Research India for 3 years. I received a Bachelor of Technology degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati in 2015. I also spent a summer at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) as a research intern in 2014.
