I"<p>I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> focusing on Machine Learning, advised by <a href="http://sungjinahn.com/">Prof. Sungjin Ahn</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in unsupervised scene representation learning and I am focusing on object-centric scene representations. I am also interested in the applications of object-centric scene representations in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Before joining Ph.D. in 2018, I worked at IBM Research India for 3 years. I received a Bachelor of Technology degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati in 2015. I also spent a summer at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) as a research intern in 2014.</p>
